        "We'll talk about this in the last section of the course, [Best Practices in React](#optional-10-best-practices-in-react), but React is significantly popular as a JS framework with community support from all over the world. You don't know it, but you've already used React before! If you've used websites like Instagram, Netflix, Reddit, Facebook, Whatsapp Web, Discord, then you've used React! Of courses, these are just a few examples of React websites, and there are tons more. Check out the [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/react/) website for the Best Designs in React Websites to see what React is capable of.\n",

        "To install React, you first need Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm)\n",
        "1. If you haven't installed Node.js during previous days, go [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)\n",
        "2. Once it's installed, create a `vite` project using this command in the terminal:\n",
        "    - `npm create vite@latest`\n",
        "3. Pick a project name with no spaces. A new folder will be created with the project name provided.\n",
        "    - Let's assume you chose `majal-webdev`\n",
        "4. Choose `React` and `JavaScript`\n",
        "    - `TypeScript` is popular, it's just `JavaScript` with strong typing. Stick with `JavaScript` if new, though!\n",
        "5. Use `cd` to change into the new directory created, then use `npm i` which will install React and all other dependencies. Finally, run `npm run dev` and press CTRL + Click on the `local` address shown, or copy it into your browser.\n",
        "    - `cd majal-webdev`\n",
        "    - `npm i`\n",
        "    - `npm run dev`\n",
        "6. Open your VS Code or favorite IDE/Code editor and open the project folder\n",
        "    - From the same terminal, you can open VS Code at the current directory using: `code .`\n",
        "7. On your code editor, navigate to the file `src/App.jsx`. This is where most of the app code is.\n",
        "8. After you're done having fun with the code, delete the following files: `index.css` and `App.css`. Then open `main.jsx` and delete the line `import './index.css'`. Go into `App.jsx`, delete everything and add these lines:\n",

        "1. Two windows side by side: one with code editor, one with browser open to the `local` address of your project. This enables you to see changes to the website as you edit code.\n",
        "2. When starting a new task, copy the task code from this file to `App.jsx`, overwriting any content that was there.\n",
        "3. When the task is done, feel free to save a copy of the file somewhere.\n",
        "4. When you get to the next task, repeat 2-4.\n",

An OPTIONAL sub-section provides extra information that is useful to clarify parts of React that you might encounter when working with it, but probably won't need to know if you don't care for the details. OPTIONAL subsections will not be included in the Tasks, but might be helpful to you when working on the **Lab Project**.\n",

        "Short-circuiting in JavaScript refers to the ability to immediately return an evaluation without needing to check the other condition. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `false && complexCalculationFunction()` - This will short-circuit because we are using the AND (&&) operator, and since we have `false` in the first position of the evaluation, we know that no matter what's on the other side, the result is always `false`\n",
        "\n",
        "- `true || factorial(1024)` - This will short-circuit because we are using the OR (||) operator, and since the first position in the evaluation is `true`, the second one doesn't matter as the full result of the evaluation will always be `true`\n",
        "\n",
        "This technique *can* provide significant performance boosts to your app, by first evaluating a quick operation before evaluating a slow one. Imagine you had to find out if a number is prime. Finding out if a number is prime can be a time-consuming task, especially for large numbers. In Mathematics, a number X is *prime* if it has no divisors except 1 and itself. You can avoid doing the calculation if you know there is a way to short-circuit the evaluation.\n",

When we return the \"Loading...\" paragraph, the component has fully loaded - so the effect gets triggered and fetches new posts. When new posts are found, `setPost()` updates the state with new data.

Here we'll take a look at popular libraries and articles that will help your React journey.\n",

        "Another bonus with learning React is the abundance of tutorials, guides, plugins, libraries, and support! React is used all around the web, on websites like: Netflix, AirBnB, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, Discord, Paypal, WhatsApp Web, and MANY more!\n",

        "- **(Beginner)** ESLint (Comes pre-installed with Vite) [Guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react): Linter for JS that alerts you on various errors in your code before you even run it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **(Beginner)** TypeScript [Guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): JavaScript but with Types. If you don't like the fact that JavaScript doesn't specify types for variables, TS is great for that. Especially helpful if you come from strongly-typed languages like Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **(Beginner)** TailwindCSS [Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility class library that lets you style components with ease. Tailwind provides you with classes that have CSS attributes, for example instead of writing `font-size: 18px` you can add a `text-lg` (text large) class to the component. There are many classes that can do pretty much whatever CSS can.\n",

        "    - `/hooks/`\n",

Well, with your newfound knowledge you can get into [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a great framework providing extra capabilities like server-side rendering, directory-based routing, and so much more. Many of your favorite websites use Next.js! Check out the showcase [here](https://nextjs.org/showcase#:~:text=Meet%20thousands%20of%20beautiful%20websites%20built%20with%20Next.js%20by%20Vercel) to see how OpenAI, Nike, TikTok, Notion, Porsche, and many more utilize Next.js.\n",

        "Or, if you like an adventure, you can get to know [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), which is a React flavor for building mobile apps. Usually, when you want to build iPhone (iOS) apps, you'd learn Swift, and for Android apps, you'd learn Kotlin or Java. Well, React Native allows you to write code and deploy your app for both iOS and Android! No need to migrate from one system to the other. It has similar concepts to React, but still needs some learning to get it right. But as someone with a background in React, you will be comfortable with the concepts.\n"
